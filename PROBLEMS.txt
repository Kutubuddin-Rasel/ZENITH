I found some problems:
1. I want to create a project using ai driven smart setup, but it don't ask my project name and it shows this error:
[Analytics] wizard_opened undefined

VM2203:63 [Wizard Debug] Has Project Name? false 

2. And then i try again, and this time i give the name with the prompt, and it's working:
